#### Microshell

Application functions as a shell-like program. Inspired by [Stephen Brennan's post](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/). Created as an assignment for my Operating Systems lab classes.

To run enter:
`$ make`
`$ ./microshell`

To display info in application type `help`
